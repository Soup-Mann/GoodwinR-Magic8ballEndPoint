IN ORDER TO PLAY YOU MUST--You must start the debug and obtain the link by clicking on the play button with a little bug on it on the left side of your screen, Click, initialize and debug, then at the top click the little green arrow and watch the code start up, then cop the http Link at the bottom, it will look something like this

Copy the link into Postman (make sure you use the correct nunbers) and then press play ! :)




Peer reviewed by Harrison Busby: I really liked the code. His responses were hilariously mean. I enjoyed how organized his code is and the way he formatted his responses was
different than mine. Overall great work Reed! :)
